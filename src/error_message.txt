You cannot host two reducers in the same scope. This doesn't work:

```
#[inline_props]
fn View(cx: Scope, store: ViewStore) -> Element {
    render! {
        div {
            store.host(...);
        }
        div {
            store.host(...);
        }
    }
}
```

Instead, within a `fn ...(cx: Scope) { ... }` there can only be
*one* `host` call. You can split up your `host` calls into minimal
`fn ViewHost1(cx: ...)`, `fn ViewHost2(cx: ...)`, `fn`s
